    <!-- WHAT IS ADHD -->
    <section id="what-is-adhd" aria-label="What is ADHD">
      <h2>What is ADHD?</h2>
      <p>
        Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is a neurodevelopmental condition that affects how the brain manages attention, focus, and impulses.
        It can influence everyday life at work, school, in relationships, and with personal well-being. While ADHD is often diagnosed in childhood,
        many people only discover it as adults.
      </p>

      <h3>Key Features of ADHD</h3>
      <p>ADHD symptoms usually fall into three main areas:</p>

      <h4>Inattention</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Struggling to stay focused on tasks</li>
        <li>Making frequent mistakes due to carelessness</li>
        <li>Finding it hard to stay organised</li>
        <li>Easily distracted by things around you or by your own thoughts</li>
        <li>Forgetting everyday tasks or appointments</li>
        <li>Avoiding tasks that require long periods of concentration</li>
        <li>Starting projects but having difficulty finishing them</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Hyperactivity</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Feeling restless or constantly “on the go”</li>
        <li>Fidgeting, tapping, or moving around frequently</li>
        <li>Talking a lot or having trouble being quiet</li>
        <li>Finding it difficult to engage in calm, quiet activities</li>
        <li>Preferring fast-paced or busy environments that match your energy level</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Impulsivity</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Acting quickly without thinking about the consequences</li>
        <li>Struggling to wait your turn</li>
        <li>Interrupting conversations or activities</li>
        <li>Blurting out thoughts unexpectedly</li>
        <li>Feeling impatient in everyday situations</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Types of ADHD</h3>
      <h4>Predominantly Inattentive Type</h4>
      <p>
        People with this type mainly struggle with focus, attention, and organisation. Hyperactive or impulsive behaviours are minimal or absent.
      </p>

      <h4>Predominantly Hyperactive-Impulsive Type</h4>
      <p>
        This type is characterised by high levels of restlessness, impulsivity, and difficulty sitting still, with fewer issues related to attention or organisation.
      </p>

      <h4>Combined Type</h4>
      <p>
        The most common type, where individuals experience a mix of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity.
      </p>

      <h3>Living with ADHD</h3>
      <p>
        ADHD can influence many areas of everyday life, including work or study, relationships, time management, organisation, and emotional well-being.
        For some people, tasks that others find straightforward can feel overwhelming or exhausting without the right support. At the same time, many people with ADHD
        also show strengths such as creativity, energy, problem-solving, and the ability to think differently.
      </p>

      <h3>Diagnosis and Support</h3>
      <p>An ADHD diagnosis is made through a comprehensive psychological assessment that explores:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Current experiences and day-to-day difficulties</li>
        <li>Developmental history and behavioural patterns</li>
        <li>The impact of these differences on work, education, relationships, and wellbeing</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Support is individualised and may include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Psychoeducation to develop a clearer understanding of ADHD and your neurotype</li>
        <li>Psychological therapy to explore emotional wellbeing, identity, and past experiences</li>
        <li>Practical strategies for organisation, attention, and emotional regulation</li>
        <li>Coaching-informed approaches to support goals, routines, and daily functioning</li>
        <li>Collaboration with medical professionals regarding medication, where appropriate</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The overall aim is to support people to work with their neurotype, rather than against it, and to build confidence, self-compassion,
        and sustainable ways of living well.
